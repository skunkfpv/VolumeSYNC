# VolumeSYNC
This Python script creates a simple GUI application using Tkinter. The application allows users to select a COM port, connect to an Arduino device through that port, and adjust the Windows system volume based on data received from the Arduino. The volume control is updated in real-time, and the user can choose the COM port from a dropdown menu in the GUI. The script utilizes the pycaw library to interact with the Windows audio system.

Install Python from: https://www.python.org/downloads/ and then run install libraries file

To discover what COM port your device is on, please run the COM SCANNER
